      <p id="consultationInformation">
        Consultations are free.
        <br/>
        During the consultation process I will showcase some of the projects which I have completed so far including some of the clients I have designed sites and web applications for, after this we then move onto discuss all of the services offered and what is charged for each service including the hourly rate.
        <br/>
        If any discounts or promotions are running the information will be made available to you at the time of sale.
        Once we have discussed what I can offer you, I will then ask for a summary of what your idea or business is about and how I can build solutions within technology to help you with your day to day tasks and promote your business idea.
        <br/>
        Once the meeting is completed you will have 14 working days to decide whether I am the perfect person for your project, if I am we will then start by to move into the specification and design phase. BUT FIRST! We have to sign contracts, disclosure forms and devise a cost invoice for the projects along with timescales and a way of tracking progress on the project.
        <br/>
        Don't worry if all of this is daunting at first, I will be here to guide you through every step of the project and advise your where neccessary.<br/>
        <br/>
        REMEMBER! I am here to advice you of what you need to turn your idea into a reality. All advice is free but should be taken with care as the information is subject to change with the grwoing technology market.
        <br/>
        HELPFUL HINT!: It is advisable to bring with you any materials that could help with the design and specification process and eventually the building of the project.
        If you do not bring these with you it could cause delays to the project, which may incur additional fees.
        Examples of these are sketches or drawings of a design, flowcharts of how processes need to be completed and any studies you may have completed prior to consultation.
